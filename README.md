# Bloom

A Discord bot made in Python using discord.py that can be configured to send reminders at a given date and time.  
Its original purpose was to send links to online classes during the global COVID crisis.

I do not actively work on it anymore as it was only meant to be a small, fun side project and 
this repo will remain archived until I pick this project up again, maybe in JS this time.  

## Limitations

* Timezone is CET only
* Stores reminders in memory, meaning they will be lost on reboot
